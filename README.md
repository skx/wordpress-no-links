wordpress-no-links
==================

A plugin to reject comment submissions that contain links with them.


Installation
------------

Place the `no-links.php` file beneath `wp-content/plugins`, and activate
it via your admin panel.

(If you prefer you can clone this repository beneath `wp-content/plugins`
instead.)

Once activated comments that have been submitted with an URL/website
link will be marked as spam automatically, post-submission.


Alternatives
------------

My [http://blogspam.net/](blogspam service) will do a far better
job of blocking comments, and there is a [wordpress plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/blogspam/) available for it..
